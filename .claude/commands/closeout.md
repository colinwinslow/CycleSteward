# `/closeout` — Session End Protocol

Use this when the user says `/closeout` or asks to end a session. Leave the repo
clean and understandable for the next session. **Don't push without asking.**

## Steps

1. **Confirm what changed this session.** `git status` and `git diff --stat`.

2. **Verify changed files match the session work.** Read back the changed
   files. If files changed that don't fit the session narrative, surface to the
   user before committing.

3. **If a feature with BDD scenarios was implemented, run the BDD-evidence
   review** by invoking the `review-bdd-evidence` subagent
   (`.claude/agents/review-bdd-evidence.md`) and confirm each scenario was
   honestly hit with raw evidence — not just claimed-as-passing.

4. **Update `STATUS.md`:**
   - Update the `Last updated:` date.
   - Update `Phase`, `Next bounded packet`, `Current readiness` if changed.
   - Tick `Active work` checkboxes for any packets that closed.
   - Add a new entry to the **"Recent sessions (rolling, last 5)"** log at the
     top: date, packet name, 1–3 sentences on what closed/changed.
   - **Trim the oldest entry if the section now exceeds 5.** Old sessions live
     in git history; do not preserve them here.
   - Update `Blockers` if any landed or cleared.

5. **Sync doc indexes if any status changed this session:**
   - ADR `draft` → `accepted`: update `docs/decisions/README.md` per its
     index-label convention.
   - New spec/research note: confirm it's listed in the relevant README.

6. **Stage and commit.** Stage specific files — never blanket `git add -A`. Use
   a HEREDOC for the message. Conventions per `CLAUDE.md`:
   - `[ADR-NNNN]` prefix for ADR commits
   - `[spec:<feature>]` prefix for spec commits
   - Why, not just what

7. **Confirm `git status` is clean** after the commit.

8. **Ask before pushing.** Default is commit-only. If the user confirms,
   `git push origin main`.

## Slice-closing completion report (in the commit body)

When a slice closes, the commit body includes:

- **Completed slice** — name/number
- **What it does** — goal + sub-steps in plain language
- **Tests run** — exact commands
- **What each test proves** — one line per test/group
- **BDD verification** — scenario, input, expected, observed
- **Artifact verification** — files the user can inspect on disk
- **Open gaps** — any mismatch between implementation, tests, and BDD
- **Next slice** — the next bounded step

Brief commits (doc tweaks, dependency bumps) skip the report.

## Rules

- Never `--no-verify` or skip hooks unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never amend a commit; create a new one if follow-up is needed.
- If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issue and create a new commit.
- A slice is not complete until the real artifact has been verified on disk.
